## Key Innovations

### **Context Engineering**
AI failures are usually context failures, not model failures. This specification provides the first systematic approach to engineering context for reliable AI assistance.

### ⚙️ **Specification-Driven AI**
Unlike traditional prompt engineering, these specifications create comprehensive, validated context that enables AI actors to perform complex, multi-step development tasks reliably.

### **Measurable Quality**
Every practice includes specific metrics, validation criteria, and continuous improvement mechanisms. No more guessing about AI assistant effectiveness.

### **Integrated Workflow**
All four specifications work together as a cohesive system, not isolated practices. Context engineering feeds into specification-driven development, which drives testing and documentation.
